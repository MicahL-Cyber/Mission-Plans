Start Time:
Duration: 6 hours
MC: mc#
Operator: student#
Analyst: analyst#

Type of Operation: Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-ISR)

Objective: Enumerate Krasnovian 1st Artillery BDE network.

Tools/Techniques: All connections will be established through SSH masquerades. Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change. Port scans must be 1000 ports or less to minimize network traffic and ssh ports are suspected to be within the 22000-22999 range. Full tcp connect scans are authorized for 1000 ports or less.

Credentials: student#::password# // administrators have been documented to frequently implement default creds on internal routers to enable incident response outsourcing.

>>If not outlined in Target Section, analysts on operation will make analytical judgment based on their target knowledge when providing credentials to test. Only three sets of credentials can be tested per target<<

Prior Approvals: sudo is authorized for use sparingly at operator discretion unless otherwise instructed. Windows Defender is assumed to be installed and enabled network wide on all Windows devices within Krasnovian 1st Artillery BDE. MD has blanket approved operating and coexisting with all Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) suites, to include Windows Defender enabled up to v. 10 /8.1 32-bit/64-bit and Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

Target Section:

T1
Hostname: EXT_RTR
IP: 10.50.25.255
OS: Linux v. unknown
Creds: student#::password#
Last Known SSH Port: 22011
Security Product(s): Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: None
Action: Perform SSH masquerade. Scan the 10.145.117.0/24 network for SSH ports. Port scans must be 1000 ports or less to minimize network traffic and are suspected to be within the 22000-22999 range. Scan discovered hosts for internal router IP for T3. Intelligence indicates they can be identified by their router config update software, which listens on port 41481. Redirect to the next target.
